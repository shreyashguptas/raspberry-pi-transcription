- For this project specifically if we want to test how the audio recording happens and play it back because the Raspberry Pi does not have a speaker or no speaker is connected to it. What we can do is wherever we save the audio file on the Raspberry Pi, give me a next command that copies the file or a command that I can run myself on my Mac that will copy a file from the Raspberry Pi, that audio file, onto my MacBook at this location '/Users/shreyashgupta/Desktop/pi-audio-test' on my mac.
